# Lab Assignment 11

In this lab you will practice working with functions.

Unlike previous labs, your class has already been created for you. 

## Let's get started!

Although not necessary for this lab, if you wish to test your solution remember to **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

## Functions

Functions in Java have a similar syntax as functions in C++, except Java may require you to include the `static` and/or `public` keywords at the beginning.

A function or method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can also pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

In Java, methods must be declared within a class. The following the the syntax for creating methods in Java:

**prefixes type methodName ( parameters ) { }**

### Prefixes

Java methods may require the prefixes `public` or `static`.

Methods with the **public** prefix are accessible outside of the class.

Methods with the **static** prefix are accessible within the class.

To find out more about prefixes visit: https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_static.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_public.asp

## Your program

**Simple Math**

For this lab assignment, complete the creation of the two methods **sum** and **max**. Both methods will receive an integer array and its size in its parameters.

The **sum** method should return the sum of all the integer values in the array.

The **max** method should return the largest value within the array.

**Test Cases**

Unlike previous labs, this lab includes test cases. To see if you passed the test cases, look for a green checkmark next to your repository in GitHub.

You can also run the following commands on your terminal in CodeSpaces:
```
./build.sh
./test.sh
```

## Submit your assignment

To submit your lab assignment click on the source control icon (3 circles with 2 lines) on your leftside navbar. Next, click on the '+' symbol next to "Changes" to stage your changes. Lastly, add a commit message (ex: "First commit") and click "Commit" then "Push" or "Sync Changes". And you're done!
