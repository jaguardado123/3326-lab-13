# Lab Assignment 11

In this lab you will practice working with functions.

Same as the previous labs, you need to set up your workspace (class and main() method).

## Let's get started!

First, let's look at the name of our .java file in the src/ directory and name your class accordingly and remember to make it **public**. Next, **create your main() method inside your class**.

Now let's begin!

## Functions

Functions in Java have a similar syntax as functions in C++, except Java requires you to include the `static` keyword at the beginning.

## Your program

**Party Inventory**
